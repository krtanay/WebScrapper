'''setup the environment
in order to use the power of python to scrap websites , we dont have to reinvent the wheel
we can use exciting lib to get the work done
we have to install following libs
pip install requests
pip install html5lib
pip install bs4

'''get the html
in order to work with html,we will have to get the HTML as a string
we will leverage the power of python requests module to get this done
the next step is to parse the html content and give it a tree like structure so that it can be traversed
'''
'''parse the html
once the html is fetched using requests as an string , we need to parse it
for parsing we will use BeautifulSoup module which will create a tree like structure
